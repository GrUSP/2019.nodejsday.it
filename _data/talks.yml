  title: "A world of Rest APIs...from Restify to a faster Fastify"
  extract: >
    In this talk I will share my experience migrating completely an entire platform of REST APIs of a phone switchboard
    system that serve thousands of customers in production.
    The migration is from using Restify to the adoption of a more efficient and performant Fastify library. We will
    consider the pros and cons of both solutions and how the performance has been increased with the simplicity of the
    code. This story is real and is about a Computer Telephony Integration system (100% Node.js) that interacts with an
    Asterisk VoIP PBX switchboard which serves thousands of customers in daily real-time audio and video communications.
    We sill se how the micro service architecture allow us to achieve modular and independent components isolated from
    each other and which can scale horizontally.

  title: "Why GraphQL vs. Why not GraphQL"
  extract: >
    In the last few years, GraphQL has been growing in popularity. A lot of companies have started adopting this
    technology to build their APIs. It has been gaining a lot of traction. In this talk, we’ll first go on to see how
    GraphQL overcomes some of the major limitations of REST. Post that, we’ll discuss some points on the case against
    GraphQL so you can have a clearer idea of whether you need GraphQL, before you jump into using it at work.

  title: "Getting Started with gRPC and Node.js"
  extract: >
    gRPC is a language independent framework for making remote procedure calls used by large companies such as Netflix,
    Docker, Google, and more. gRPC leverages technologies such as HTTP2 and protocol buffers to create efficient network
    based applications. This talk provides an introduction to basic gRPC concepts, and shows how the framework can be
    used in both browser and Node.js applications. This talk will compare and contrast the various modules available to
    JavaScript developers, including grpc, @grpc/grpc-js, @grpc/proto-loader, grpc-server-js, and grpc-web. Finally,
    the talk will discuss certain architectural tradeoffs that come with gRPC-based systems.

  title: "Allegro.pl in flames"
  extract: >
    There is a quote by Donald Knuth: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - everyone seems to know it, but
    how do we know it's true? When the time comes when we need to squeeze more juice out of our app, what should be
    optimized? In this presentation, we will look at ways to analyze and optimize the performance of OpBox - the
    service responsible for rendering the fifth most-visited online marketplace in Europe. I will mostly focus on flame
    graph analysis, node.js profilers, worker_threads, v8 optimizations and performance tips.

  title: "Designing Node.js applications for scalability, observability, maintainability and K8S deployability"
  extract: >
    In this talk, we will dig into:
    1. Implement Clean Architecture (SOLID principles) for Node.js application using inversion of control and Typescript.
    2. Implement Observability : K8S endpoints, logging, monitoring and alerting
    3. Benchmark for scalability and correct bottleneck.
    4. Best practices for container and K8S deployment.

  title: "I want to publish my first Open Source library"
  extract: >
    While working on a project, you wrote a utility to solve a problem. Then you started using it in other projects.
    It looks like the code you wrote is very useful, and other people might benefit from it, so you decided to publish
    it on GitHub. What should you do?
    In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of Open Source, work with the community, choose a license, API design and
    developer experience, the importance of writing test, and how to write proper documentation. You cannot miss any of
    those if you want your library to be successful, and if it does, you will be a maintainer. And now?

  title: "What's new in Node.js testing"
  extract: >
    As the architecture of applications rapidly changes with dramatic changes (serverless, K8S, etc) so does the TESTING
    world introduces a new offering to cope with the new challenges. This session aims to keep you up-to-date by packing
    all those updates and opportunities into colorful demos: we're about to travel across the latest Node.js testing
    trends, emerging & powerful techniques and neat tools like mutation testing, snapshots, fuzzing and others.
