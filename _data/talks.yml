#   title: Event loop tales on I/O bound Node.js applications
#   extract: >
#     At brumbrum.it we have a zoo of microservices, interaction between them is obviously carried out through REST APIs.
#     Our www microservice, aka frontend, is an isomorphic/universal JavaScript application bounded between users and the
#     zoo, lots of 1:n HTTP requests there.
#     Taming this type of Node.js application in production to survive traffic spikes and other wild behaviors brought us
#     to deeply understand Node.js non-blocking model: it's too easy to react to problems with CDN and infamous
#     memory/thread allocations.
#     Node.js non-blocking model comes with simplicity in mind. In many cases this simplicity allows you to build apps
#     quickly. But when you reach the edge, simplicity means responsibility. Let's dive in!
