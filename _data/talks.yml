  title: "Why GraphQL vs. Why not GraphQL"
  extract: >
    In the last few years, GraphQL has been growing in popularity. A lot of companies have started adopting this
    technology to build their APIs. It has been gaining a lot of traction. In this talk, we’ll first go on to see how
    GraphQL overcomes some of the major limitations of REST. Post that, we’ll discuss some points on the case against
    GraphQL so you can have a clearer idea of whether you need GraphQL, before you jump into using it at work.

  title: "Getting Started with gRPC and Node.js"
  extract: >
    gRPC is a language independent framework for making remote procedure calls used by large companies such as Netflix,
    Docker, Google, and more. gRPC leverages technologies such as HTTP2 and protocol buffers to create efficient network
    based applications. This talk provides an introduction to basic gRPC concepts, and shows how the framework can be
    used in both browser and Node.js applications. This talk will compare and contrast the various modules available to
    JavaScript developers, including grpc, @grpc/grpc-js, @grpc/proto-loader, grpc-server-js, and grpc-web. Finally,
    the talk will discuss certain architectural tradeoffs that come with gRPC-based systems.
