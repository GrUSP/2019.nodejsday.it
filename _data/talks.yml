  title: "A world of Rest APIs...from Restify to a faster Fastify"
  extract: >
    In this talk I will share my experience migrating completely an entire platform of REST APIs of a phone switchboard
    system that serve thousands of customers in production.
    The migration is from using Restify to the adoption of a more efficient and performant Fastify library. We will
    consider the pros and cons of both solutions and how the performance has been increased with the simplicity of the
    code. This story is real and is about a Computer Telephony Integration system (100% Node.js) that interacts with an
    Asterisk VoIP PBX switchboard which serves thousands of customers in daily real-time audio and video communications.
    We sill se how the micro service architecture allow us to achieve modular and independent components isolated from
    each other and which can scale horizontally.

  title: "Why GraphQL vs. Why not GraphQL"
  extract: >
    In the last few years, GraphQL has been growing in popularity. A lot of companies have started adopting this
    technology to build their APIs. It has been gaining a lot of traction. In this talk, we’ll first go on to see how
    GraphQL overcomes some of the major limitations of REST. Post that, we’ll discuss some points on the case against
    GraphQL so you can have a clearer idea of whether you need GraphQL, before you jump into using it at work.

  title: "Getting Started with gRPC and Node.js"
  extract: >
    gRPC is a language independent framework for making remote procedure calls used by large companies such as Netflix,
    Docker, Google, and more. gRPC leverages technologies such as HTTP2 and protocol buffers to create efficient network
    based applications. This talk provides an introduction to basic gRPC concepts, and shows how the framework can be
    used in both browser and Node.js applications. This talk will compare and contrast the various modules available to
    JavaScript developers, including grpc, @grpc/grpc-js, @grpc/proto-loader, grpc-server-js, and grpc-web. Finally,
    the talk will discuss certain architectural tradeoffs that come with gRPC-based systems.

#  title: "Build Scalable APIs using GraphQL and Serverless"
#  extract: >
#    Current trends in software and backend architecture have been evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. 
#    I am sure most of you have heard of microservice based architectures. 
#    The latest development on that front in the past couple of years has been the advent of serverless which allows you 
#    to run applications in very cost effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API 
#    that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint.
#    GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook. 
#    We will first have a look at how we set up our own GraphQL server locally, then we will explore the Query language
#    and schema definitions it provides which allows you essentially query your mesh of services from a single point of entry. 
#    The beauty of that is it will notify you early if any of your endpoints is misbehaving or the schemas are out of date by erroring out.
#    Another advantage of this is that it allows for your API documentation to be a real time process 
#    and it will give you what one may call an API playground where you can query and explore your API.
#    After we explore our serverless API we will have a look at the more advanced features and standards
#    around mutators and resolvers and then we will close by going all in, full serverless and deploy our graphql server 
#    to a function in the cloud.

  title: "I want to publish my first Open Source library"
  extract: >
    While working on a project, you wrote a utility to solve a problem. Then you started using it in other projects.
    It looks like the code you wrote is very useful, and other people might benefit from it, so you decided to publish
    it on GitHub. What should you do?
    In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of Open Source, work with the community, choose a license, API design and
    developer experience, the importance of writing test, and how to write proper documentation. You cannot miss any of
    those if you want your library to be successful, and if it does, you will be a maintainer. And now?

  extract: >
    As the architecture of applications rapidly changes with dramatic changes (serverless, K8S, etc) so does the TESTING
    world introduces a new offering to cope with the new challenges. This session aims to keep you up-to-date by packing
    all those updates and opportunities into colorful demos: we're about to travel across the latest Node.js testing
    trends, emerging & powerful techniques and neat tools like mutation testing, snapshots, fuzzing and others.
